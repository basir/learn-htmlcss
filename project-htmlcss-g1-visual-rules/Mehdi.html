    <p>
      As I am writing this letter, I have thousands of thoughts running through
      my mind. Through this letter I wanted to express my love for you that is
      honestly hard to put into words.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Do you know how much you mean to me? There isn't a day that goes by when
      my mind isn't thinking of you. You are the reason behind every piece of
      joy in my life.You are the one that has lifted me up to show me the beauty
      of life.There is no other person in this world that could have done that
      for me.
